Types of interface:
    - Normal - an interface with 2 or more methods
    - Functional (or Single Abstract Method  - SAM)
    - Marker - an interface with NO methods - Useful for serialization and deserialization - which can be understood as load saved game analogy in games

Revision NOTE: all methods in interface are public abstract
